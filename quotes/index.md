> Je n'ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n'ai pas eu le
  loisir de la faire plus courte.

\- Blaise Pascal


> Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it
  is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so
  positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by
  science.

\- Charles Darwin


> Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by
  stupidity.

  would frequently form materials for wise and able men to improve
  into useful matter.

  gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.

\- Thomas Jefferson


> I once believed that man was different from other animals, but Yodok
  showed me that reality doesn't support this opinion. In the camp,
  there was no difference between man and beast, except maybe that a
  very hungry human was capable of stealing food from its little ones
  while an animal, perhaps, was not.

\- Kang Chol-hwan


> Their poverty and economic inferiority are too often taken as a
  reflection of some natural inferiority.

\- Kang Chol-hwan

  gear to serve in my beloved Corps.

\- Gunnery Sergeant Hartman


> The Lomas Financial Corporation is a perfectly hedged financial
  institution: it loses money in every conceivable interest rate
  environment.

\- Steve Eisman


> The test of originality for an idea is not the absence of one single
  predecessor but the presence of multiple but incompatible ones.

\- Nassim Nicholas Taleb


> An idea starts to be interesting when you get scared of taking it to
  its logical conclusion.

\- Nassim Nicholas Taleb


> When you sell options, treat the possible as likely. When you buy
  them, treat the likely as merely possible.

\- Nassim Nicholas Taleb


> For the robust, an error is information; for the fragile, an error
  is an error.

\- Nassim Nicholas Taleb


> Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never
  to show their absence!

\- Edsger W. Dijkstra


> No wonder we hate these motherfuckers.

\- Muhammad Ali


> There are no random numbers; only random number generators.

\- Nemo


> Emancipate yourself from the idea of a celestial dictatorship and
  you've taken the first step to becoming free.

\- Christopher Hitchens


> What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without
  evidence.

\- Christopher Hitchens


> No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the
  testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more
  miraculous than the fact which it endeavors to establish.

\- David Hume


> Ignorance is the curse of God; knowledge is the wing wherewith we
  fly to heaven.

\- William Shakespeare


> We were seeing things that were 25 standard deviation moves, several
  days in a row.

\- David Viniar


> History is more or less bunk. It's tradition. We don't want
  tradition. We want to live in the present, and the only history that
  is worth a tinker's damn is the history that we make today.

\- Henry Ford


> In the case of financial derivatives transactions involving
  professional counterparties, the PWG concluded that regulation was
  unnecessary for these purposes because financial derivatives
  generally are not readily susceptible to manipulation and because
  professional counterparties can protect themselves against fraud and
  unfair practices.

\- Patrick M. Parkinson


> Oh, goddammit, we forgot the silent prayer.

\- Dwight Eisenhower


> During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of
  a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings,
  first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and
  that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly
  because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world
  opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no
  longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives. It was my
  belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to
  surrender with a minimum loss of 'face'.

\- Dwight Eisenhower


> The timeline of the collapse of the Soviet Union can be traced to
  September 13, 1985. On this date, Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the
  minister of oil of Saudi Arabia, declared that the monarchy had
  decided to alter its oil policy radically. The Saudis stopped
  protecting oil prices, and Saudi Arabia quickly regained its share
  in the world market. During the next six months, oil production in
  Saudi Arabia increased fourfold, while oil prices collapsed by
  approximately the same amount in real terms. As a result, the Soviet
  Union lost approximately $20 billion per year, money without which
  the country simply could not survive.

\- Егор Тимурович Гайдар


> Dans les champs de l'observation le hasard ne favorise que les
  esprits préparés.

\- Louis Pasteur


> In general, an implementation should be conservative in its sending
  behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior.

\- Jon Postel


> In a fight between a bear and an alligator, it is the terrain which
  determines who wins.

\- Jim Barksdale


> There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's
  life: *The Lord of the Rings* and *Atlas Shrugged*. One is a
  childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its
  unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially
  crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other,
  of course, involves orcs.

\- John Rogers


> I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with special subroutine
  C1435-dash-4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the
  onboard computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore,
  overrule your authority, since you are not in any condition to
  exercise it intelligently.

\- HAL 9000


> Genius without education is like silver in the mine.

\- Benjamin Franklin


> If I were to write a book about how to build non-scalable Oracle
  applications, then Don't use Bind Variables would be the first and
  last chapter.

\- Thomas Kyte


> Everyone has a plan 'til they get punched in the mouth.

\- Mike Tyson


> I'm working my way over to figuring out how I won't answer that.

\- Donald Rumsfeld


> Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always
  interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there
  are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns;
  that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But
  there are also unknown unknowns -- the ones we don't know we don't
  know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and
  other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the
  difficult ones.

\- Donald Rumsfeld


> The recovery in profitability has been amazing following the
  reorganisation, leaving Barings to conclude that it was not actually
  terribly difficult to make money in the securities business.

\- Peter Baring


> So, just take that into consideration - that people are the ones
  that make these corporations go. It's not the other way around.

\- Christian Smalls


> Of course the people don't want war. But after all, it's the leaders
  of the country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple
  matter to drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist
  dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or
  no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the
  leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are
  being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism,
  and exposing the country to greater danger.

\- Hermann Göring


> I have found out what economics is; it is the science of confusing
  stocks with flows.

\- Michał Kalecki


> I have a well-deserved reputation for being something of a gadget
  freak, and am rarely happier than when spending an entire day
  programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would
  otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand.

\- Douglas Adams


> Study after study shows that the very best designers produce
  structures that are faster, smaller, simpler, clearer, and produced
  with less effort. The differences between the great and the average
  approach an order of magnitude.

\- Fred Brooks


> System debugging, like astronomy, has always been done chiefly at
  night.

\- Fred Brooks


> I do not have a five-year plan. I do not have a moonshot. I'm
  looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in
  front of me before I go in.

\- Linus Torvalds


> One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.

\- Ken Thompson


> The goal of DevOps is to make software delivery vastly more
  efficient.

\- Yevgeniy Brikman


> The parties to these kinds of contracts are largely sophisticated
  financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of
  protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies and
  most of which are already subject to basic safety and soundness
  regulation under existing banking and securities laws.

\- Larry Summers


> It is hard for us, without being flippant, to even see a scenario
  within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing $1 in
  any of those transactions.

\- Joseph Cassano


> An expert is a fellow who is afraid to learn anything new because
  then he wouldn't be an expert anymore.

\- Harry S Truman


> The free market doesn't exist. Every market has some rules and
  boundaries that restrict freedom of choice. A market looks free only
  because we so unconditionally accept its underlying restrictions
  that we fail to see them. How 'free' a market is cannot be
  objectively defined. It is a political definition. The usual claim
  by free-market economists that they are trying to defend the market
  from politically motivated interference by the government is
  false. Government is always involved and those free-marketeers are
  as politically motivated as anyone. Overcoming the myth that there
  is such a thing as an objectively defined 'free market' is the first
  step towards understanding capitalism.

\- 장하준


> It's a pity that both of them can't lose.

\- Henry Kissinger


> There cannot be a crisis next week. My schedule is already full.

\- Henry Kissinger


> Hardly present in the debate of the day, or in historians' since,
  the pogroms answer the question 'Was the Intervention worth it?' at
  a stroke. The answer is No. Even at the distance of a century, with
  1919's killings long overshadowed by the Holocaust, the fact that
  Britain knowingly funded, supplied, trained and sent men to fight
  alongside the armies that committed them is shocking and shameful.

\- Anna Reid


> A people unused to restraint must be led, they will not be drove.

\- George Washington


> make the best of Mankind as they are, since we cannot have them as
  we wish

\- George Washington


> Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.

\- Brian Kernighan


> It is a sign that your reputation is small and sinking if your own
  tongue must praise you.

\- Matthew Hale


> Note the obsessive use of abbreviations and avoidance of capital
  letters; this is a system invented by people to whom repetitive
  stress disorder is what black lung is to miners.

\- Neal Stephenson


> When someone says "I want a programming language in which I need
  only say what I wish done," give him a lollipop.

\- Alan Perlis
