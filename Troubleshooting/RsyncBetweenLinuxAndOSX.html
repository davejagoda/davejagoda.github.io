    Here are some of the problems that may be encountered.

    <h3>rsync: delete_file: rmdir "/Users/dj/Name" failed: Directory not empty (66)</h3>

    Possible cause: You have a directory called "Name" and a file
    called "name" on the Linux machine (or other combinations such
    that they are seen as the same on the OSX side). In order to
    encounter this, OSX will be using a case-insensitive file system,
    which is the default.

    <h3>rsync keeps transferring some files repeatedly</h3>

    Possible cause: You have a file which has a name containing
    non-ASCII characters (e.g. "José") that can be composed more than
    one way. Quoting
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#UnicodeSubtleties">this<a>:

    <blockquote>
      For example, the character "é" can be represented as the single
      Unicode character u+00E9 (latin small letter e with acute), or
      as the two Unicode characters u+0065 and u+0301 (the letter "e"
      plus a combining acute symbol).
    </blockquote>

    OS X will always store the fully decomposed (also known as NFD)
    name, while Linux preserves whatever name it is presented. So on
    Linux, you could have two files named "José", one with an NFD
    name, and other with a composed (also known as NFC) name. On OS X,
    those two files would map to the same name, causing one to be
    overwritten on each rsync from Linux.
