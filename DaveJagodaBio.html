    My name is David Jagoda and I'm a partner at a16z responsible for
    evaluating technical talent.  I enjoy learning about the
    technologies our portfolio companies use.

    <br>

    Before joining the firm, I spent 10 years in various roles at
    Loudcloud (I was the first Consulting Engineer), then Opsware (I
    was the first Support Engineer), and finally Hewlett Packard
    (where I was an Engineering Director).  Prior to that, I've worked
    as a Sales Engineer, Customer Support Engineer, and Software
    Developer at companies such as Netscape, Netlabs, and Morgan
    Stanley.

    <br>

    When I'm not working, I enjoy tinkering with computers and
    networks, riding my bike, and spending time with my family.
