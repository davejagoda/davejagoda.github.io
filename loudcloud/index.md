1999-10: Subleased from Ultra Clean Technology, 150 Independence
Drive, Menlo Park (since torn down)

2000-01: The Warehouse, 615 Tasman Drive, Sunnyvale (since torn down)

2000-05: The Taj, 599 N. Mathilda Avenue, Sunnyvale (later LinkedIn
and now Microsoft)

I'm pretty confident about all those dates, but now it gets less clear
to me:

2001-01? Expanded into 1030 W. Maude Avenue (operations teams move in,
everyone else stays in the Taj, there's a cafeteria, I remember a
Mardi Gras party)

2001-06?: Consolidated back to the Taj
