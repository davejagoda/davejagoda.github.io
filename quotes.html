      <p>
	Je n’ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n’ai pas eu
	le loisir de la faire plus courte.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - Blaise Pascal
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does
	knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know
	much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will
	never be solved by science.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

      - Charles Darwin
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained
	by stupidity.

      <p>
	One good thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain.

    <p>
      - Bob Marley
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Could the straggling thoughts of individuals be collected,
	they would frequently form materials for wise and able men to
	improve into useful matter.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

      - Thomas Paine
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	I once believed that man was different from other animals, but
	Yodok showed me that reality doesn't support this opinion.  In
	the camp, there was no difference between man and beast,
	except maybe that a very hungry human was capable of stealing
	food from its little ones while an animal, perhaps, was not.

      <p>
	Their poverty and economic inferiority are too often taken as
	a reflection of some natural inferiority.

      <p>
	And my orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack
	the gear to serve in my beloved Corps.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
	The Lomas Financial Corporation is a perfectly hedged financial
	institution: it loses money in every conceivable interest rate
	environment.

      - Steve Eisman
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	The test of originality for an idea is not the absence of one
	single predecessor but the presence of multiple but
	incompatible ones.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - Nassim Nicholas Taleb
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but
	never to show their absence!
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - Edsger W. Dijkstra
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	No wonder we hate these motherfuckers.
      </p>
