      <p>
	Je n'ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n'ai pas eu
	le loisir de la faire plus courte.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - Blaise Pascal
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does
	knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know
	much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will
	never be solved by science.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - Charles Darwin
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained
	by stupidity.

      - Bob Marley
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Could the straggling thoughts of individuals be collected,
	they would frequently form materials for wise and able men to
	improve into useful matter.

    <p>
      - Thomas Paine
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	But it does me no injury for my neighbour to say there are
	twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks
	my leg.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - Thomas Jefferson
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	I once believed that man was different from other animals, but
	Yodok showed me that reality doesn't support this opinion.  In
	the camp, there was no difference between man and beast,
	except maybe that a very hungry human was capable of stealing
	food from its little ones while an animal, perhaps, was not.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
	The Lomas Financial Corporation is a perfectly hedged financial
	institution: it loses money in every conceivable interest rate
	environment.

      - Steve Eisman
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	The test of originality for an idea is not the absence of one
	single predecessor but the presence of multiple but
	incompatible ones.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - Nassim Nicholas Taleb
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	An idea starts to be interesting when you get scared of taking
	it to its logical conclusion.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - Nassim Nicholas Taleb
    </p>

      <p>
	Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but
	never to show their absence!

    <p>
      - Christopher Hitchens
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Ignorance is the curse of God; knowledge is the wing wherewith
	we fly to heaven.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - William Shakespeare
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	We were seeing things that were 25 standard deviation moves,
	several days in a row.

    <p>
      - David Viniar
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	History is more or less bunk. It's tradition. We don't want
	tradition. We want to live in the present, and the only
	history that is worth a tinker's damn is the history that we
	make today.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - Henry Ford
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	In the case of financial derivatives transactions involving
	professional counterparties, the PWG concluded that regulation
	was unnecessary for these purposes because financial
	derivatives generally are not readily susceptible to
	manipulation and because professional counterparties can
	protect themselves against fraud and unfair practices.

    <p>
      - Dwight Eisenhower
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been
	conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my
	grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan
	was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely
	unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country
	should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon
	whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a
	measure to save American lives. It was my belief that Japan
	was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender with a
	minimum loss of 'face'.

	Dans les champs de l'observation le hasard ne favorise que les
	esprits préparés.

    <p>
      - Louis Pasteur
    </p>

      <p>
	In general, an implementation should be conservative in its
	sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior.
