	Je n'ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n'ai pas eu
	le loisir de la faire plus courte.

    <p>
      - Blaise Pascal
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does
	knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know
	much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will
	never be solved by science.
      </p>

      - Thomas Paine
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	But it does me no injury for my neighbour to say there are
	twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks
	my leg.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - Thomas Jefferson
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	I once believed that man was different from other animals, but
	Yodok showed me that reality doesn't support this opinion.  In
	the camp, there was no difference between man and beast,
	except maybe that a very hungry human was capable of stealing
	food from its little ones while an animal, perhaps, was not.

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	The test of originality for an idea is not the absence of one
	single predecessor but the presence of multiple but
	incompatible ones.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      - Nassim Nicholas Taleb
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

    <p>
      - Christopher Hitchens
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the
	testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more
	miraculous than the fact which it endeavors to establish.

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	History is more or less bunk. It's tradition. We don't want
	tradition. We want to live in the present, and the only
	history that is worth a tinker's damn is the history that we
	make today.
      </p>

    <p>
      - Henry Ford
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	In the case of financial derivatives transactions involving
	professional counterparties, the PWG concluded that regulation
	was unnecessary for these purposes because financial
	derivatives generally are not readily susceptible to
	manipulation and because professional counterparties can
	protect themselves against fraud and unfair practices.

      - Dwight Eisenhower
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been
	conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my
	grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan
	was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely
	unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country
	should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon
	whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a
	measure to save American lives. It was my belief that Japan
	was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender with a
	minimum loss of 'face'.

      - Dwight Eisenhower
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	The timeline of the collapse of the Soviet Union can be traced
	to September 13, 1985. On this date, Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani,
	the minister of oil of Saudi Arabia, declared that the
	monarchy had decided to alter its oil policy radically. The
	Saudis stopped protecting oil prices, and Saudi Arabia quickly
	regained its share in the world market. During the next six
	months, oil production in Saudi Arabia increased fourfold,
	while oil prices collapsed by approximately the same amount in
	real terms. As a result, the Soviet Union lost approximately
	$20 billion per year, money without which the country simply
	could not survive.

	In a fight between a bear and an alligator, it is the terrain

    <p>
      - Jim Barksdale
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year
	old's life: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lord of the
	Rings</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Atlas
	Shrugged</span>. One is a childish fantasy that often
	engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes,
	leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled
	adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of
	course, involves orcs.

	I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with special subroutine
	C1435-dash-4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated,

	therefore, overrule your authority, since you are not in any
	condition to exercise it intelligently.
